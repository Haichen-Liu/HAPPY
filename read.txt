Convolutional neural networks (CNN) often struggle to accurately detect human poses from complex scenes. To tackle this challenge while enabling more comprehensive and accurate analysis of human motion, a novel framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, high-precision pose estimation is achieved through the OpenPose model. Then, the human skeletons are extracted to deliver the coordinates of key points. Finally, the angle depicted the motion characteristics is calculated and compared with a preset standard to effectively identify different human actions. Furthermore, extensive experiments were conducted based on the COCO2017 dataset to demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of proposed framework, in which our AR, AP and mAP reached 89.2%, 79.8% and 81.8%, respectively. The comprehensive patterns of human behavior and movements recognized by proposed approach can be utilized in a wide range of applications, e.g., sports analysis, healthcare monitoring and human-computer interaction.
