The enhancement of societal living standards has led to a widespread increase in fitness awareness, consequently fueling a sustained upswing in sports' popularity. Numerous individuals choose to pursue engaging physical activities by adhering to online guidance provided by fitness bloggers. However, owing to various objective factors, most practitioners encounter challenges in precisely replicating the bloggers' instructions, resulting in suboptimal training outcomes and, in some instances, an elevated risk of physical injury. Moreover, the growing concern of aging populations has intensified the demand for rehabilitation training among the elderly. Nevertheless, the provision of professional rehabilitation training not only imposes a financial burden on families but also places strain on medical resources. Currently, prevalent human action recognition methods fall into two principal categories: traditional action recognition methods and those grounded in deep learning principles. Despite being in the early stages of exploration, these methodologies suggest substantial potential for expansive application and commercial value.
In the realm of human motion estimation and behavior recognition, OpenPose has garnered considerable attention for its rapid and accurate detection and tracking of key points on the human body from images or videos. This capability provides robust technical support for various applications, including human motion analysis, behavior recognition, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. OpenPose holds substantial promise in addressing health monitoring, motion analysis, posture correction, and other related demands, thereby contributing to the advancement of human behavior understanding and intelligent technology. Presently, research efforts on OpenPose primarily focus on enhancing its accuracy and robustness in complex scenes. This involves the introduction of advanced network structures, optimization of attitude estimation algorithms, and integration of data from other sensors. However, OpenPose encounters challenges, particularly in complex scenarios where multiple individuals share the same space, leading to issues such as partial occlusion or rapid movements that may result in inaccuracies during human motion analysis. Furthermore, challenges persist in the allocation and tracking of key points in multi-person scenes, particularly when there is occlusion or contact between human bodies. Real-time performance also remains an area for improvement, especially when processing high-resolution video. Additionally, OpenPose faces difficulties in recognizing and analyzing specific motion actions, necessitating further data acquisition and algorithm refinement to enhance accuracy. Addressing these challenges is crucial for unlocking the full potential of OpenPose in diverse applications.
In order to comprehensively and precisely analyze human motion information, this paper presents a framework for motion estimation and behavior recognition. Initially, human image key points are identified utilizing OpenPose. Subsequently, the characterization of human pose involves calculating angle information between joints, facilitating more accurate motion recognition and classification. Furthermore, the paper investigates the adjustment mechanism of the OpenPose key point detection threshold and the minimum visibility of human key points, resulting in enhanced quality and accuracy in motion evaluation. Upon implementation of the proposed method on equipment with digital image acquisition capabilities, such as the K210 camera module, it becomes a valuable tool for correcting the posture of home exercise enthusiasts. Simultaneously, it provides constructive feedback and suggestions for improving the proper form of athletes. Additionally, the method proves beneficial in aiding the elderly or individuals with sports-related injuries to undergo effective rehabilitation training.
